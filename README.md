## Middle Earth Rounders Club

The Middle Earth Rounders Club (https://middleearthroundersclub.netlify.app/)
is a project made by Jos Bakker, as a part of the third module of the IronHack â€“ Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

## Description

Are you someone who likes to travel? Perhaps your next destination could be Middle Earth? Are you a poker player, looking for a nice game? Perhaps accompanied by some music or a nice cold ale? Or are you an innkeeper, and business has been slow so you added a couple of poker tables to the lobby, could very well bring more business, right? Then this app will be for you!

## MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

The requirements for this project in a nutshell:

-	Simple website / app
-	3 Models + 2 Relationship
-	CRUD + Auth (JWT)
-	2 separate repositories:
-	Backend (REST API) with node 
-	Express - Frontend with React


## Backlog

1. In the future more styling will be applied throughout the whole app.
2. Search bar will be implemented, to search your favourite poker locations and you will be able to skim through the reviews .
3. Social media channels will be developed and links will be added to the site.
4. We will try to organize city-trips to the Shire and Mordor with groups of poker players from all over the world, perhaps even organize a really, like really big tournament: the WSOMEP (World Series of Middle Earth Poker). Contacts with ESPN have been made.
